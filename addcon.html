            Don't I need a development enviroment to work with JavaScript ? 
        </dt>
        <dd>
            No, you don't necessarily need a dedicated development environment to work with JavaScript. 
            JavaScript can be written and executed directly in a web browser. You can use any text editor or 
            code editor of your choice to write JavaScript code.

            What is AJAX ?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques used to create asynchronous web applications. 
            It enables data to be exchanged between a web page and a server in the background, without the need for a full page refresh.

            The key idea behind AJAX is to make HTTP requests from JavaScript code to retrieve 
            data from a server and update parts of a web page dynamically, without disrupting the user experience. 
            This allows for a more responsive and interactive user interface.

            When I use JavaScript , do I need to accomodate users whose browsers may not support JavaScript or who have disabled it ? 
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Yes, when using JavaScript, it is essential to consider users whose browsers may not support JavaScript or have it disabled. While JavaScript is 
            widely supported by modern web browsers, there are still some situations 
            where JavaScript may not be available or enabled for various reasons
